\# Algorithm Complexity Analyzer



This project analyzes the time complexity of algorithms using both

empirical runtime measurements (C++) and mathematical curve fitting (Python).



\## Features

\- C++ implementations of classic algorithms

\- Runtime measurement using high-resolution timers

\- CSV-based data logging

\- Python-based complexity classification



\## Folder Structure

cpp/        -> Algorithm implementations and timers  

data/       -> Runtime datasets  

python/     -> Mathematical modeling and curve fitting  



\## How to Run

1\. Compile C++ programs

2\. Generate runtime data

3\. Run Python scripts for analysis
